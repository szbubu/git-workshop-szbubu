2 sudents are enough.

1. Select your Github account for the Owner.
2. You can name the repository as you want, it will be created with this name in your account.
3. You can choose public or private repo. I would recommend private, because it is not a project just an exercise, maybe you don't want to everybody see it.
4. You can keep include all branches unchecked.
5. Click on the create repository

## Invite your peer to your new repo

Navigate to your newly created repo in your Github account.
